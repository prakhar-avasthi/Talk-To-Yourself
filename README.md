# Talk To Yourself
It is an application which I have developed while studying web development.
This is let's you talk to yourself. You can record your day or anything that you want to say to yourself. Just write and once you save them, it will store them in Database.

I have used python as programming language.
I have used Flask as my web development framework and SQLite as database.

Future improvements:
1. Multiple users.
2. Able to delete blogs.
3. improved UI
