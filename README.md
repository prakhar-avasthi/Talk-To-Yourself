# bloging_application
It is a blogging application which I have developed while studying web development.
This is let's you write blogs and once you save them, it will store them in Database.
You can see your blogs once you log in.

I have used python as programming language.
I have used Flask as my web development framework and SQLite as database.

Future improvements:
1. Multiple users.
2. able to delete blogs.
3. improved UI
